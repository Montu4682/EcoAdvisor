Requirement Document: Eco Guardian - AI-Powered Waste Reduction & Reusability Advisor
1. Project Title
Eco Guardian: AI-Powered Waste Reduction & Reusability Advisor
2. Problem Statement
With increasing environmental awareness, most consumers are still unaware of the environmental impact of single-use items in their daily lives. Tracking and reducing individual waste is difficult due to a lack of easily accessible tools. There is a need for an AI-powered solution that offers real-time suggestions for reusable alternatives, reducing waste effectively.
3. Objective
To develop an AI-powered chatbot that:‚Ä®- Identifies disposable or wasteful items from user-submitted images.‚Ä®- Provides eco-friendly, reusable alternatives.‚Ä®- Estimates CO2 savings by switching to greener alternatives.‚Ä®- Suggests nearby recycling centers or eco-friendly stores.‚Ä®- Encourages sustainable behavior via gamification and reward points.‚Ä®- Displays news feeds and event boards related to environmental sustainability.
4. Key Features & Functional Requirements
a. Identify Items
Input: Image of a plastic bottle, food container, etc.‚Ä®Technology: Use Computer Vision and AI-powered image recognition.‚Ä®Output: Identify the type of object (e.g., plastic bottle).
b. Provide Eco-Friendly Alternatives
Suggest reusable/recyclable alternatives (e.g., stainless steel bottle, bamboo toothbrush).‚Ä®Use LLM or text generation model to generate suggestions dynamically.
c. Suggest Local Recycling Centers
Use Google Maps API to show nearby:‚Ä®- Recycling centers‚Ä®- Stores selling reusable alternatives
d. Estimate Environmental Impact
Estimate CO2 saved by switching from disposable to reusable items.‚Ä®Use online data from sites like www.carbonfootprint.com.
e. Gamify the Experience
Reward system: 'EcoPoints'.‚Ä®Encourage user to make greener decisions and track progress.‚Ä®Add point system or quizzes.
f. News Feed & Events
Integrate notice board/news section using Google search with custom filters.‚Ä®Show sustainability events, awareness news, and local environmental meetups.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
- User-friendly UI (Web/mobile app or chatbot interface)‚Ä®- Responsive design‚Ä®- Voice-over support in screen recording‚Ä®- Scalable architecture for image processing and NLP
6. Tech Stack Suggestions

7. Deliverables
- PPT: Solution architecture, approach (in PDF format).‚Ä®- Screen Recording: Explanation of the full system (voice-over mandatory).
8. Prompt Examples for Implementation
üì∏ Image Identification Prompt
You are an AI model that receives an image. Detect if the object in the image is a disposable item (plastic, paper cup, etc.) and output the name of the object.
üåø Eco-Friendly Suggestion Prompt
Based on the object '[object name]', suggest eco-friendly, reusable alternatives. Provide 2‚Äì3 practical and affordable options.
üìç Local Recycling Center Search Prompt
Using Google Maps API, find and display nearby recycling centers or eco-friendly shops near [user location or GPS coordinates].
üí® Environmental Impact Estimation Prompt
Calculate how much CO2 can be saved annually if a user switches from [disposable item] to [reusable alternative], using data from www.carbonfootprint.com or similar resources.
üéÆ Gamification Prompt
Reward the user with points for every switch to an eco-friendly product. Track their progress and show motivational messages after every milestone (e.g., 10 items replaced = 100 EcoPoints).
